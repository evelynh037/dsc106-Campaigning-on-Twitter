          <p>The presidential election in the United States is conducted through an especially interesting system, in which two types of voting, popular vote and electoral vote are taken into evaluation. Each state is given a different amount of electoral votes based on its population. Then people do popular vote within each state. Whoever wins the popular vote of a state takes all of that state's electoral vote. The winner is whoever receives the most electoral votes.</p>
          <p><b>Does winner of popular vote wins the actual election?</b></p>
          <p>Now you might be thinking that since the amount of electoral votes per state is determined by its population, the winner of the popular vote national-wise is likely the winner of the election. But due to uncertainty within this system, sometimes it might not be the case... The 2016 presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is a classic example and let's dive into the reason together</p>
        </section>
        <section class="centered-content">
          <p>Notice the result of the two votes are different as shown in the chart on the left. While logically speaking this is a possible result, can we make any reasonable explanation as for why in this case, despite the disadvantage in overall popular vote, Trump still won the overall electoral vote? </p>
          <br>
          <p>Well, it turns out that one way to explain this is through analyzing what they put more focus on during their presidential campaign, that is, the content of their campaign.</p>
          <p>Twitter has played an increasingly prominent role in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Debates have raged and candidates have risen and fallen based on tweets. </p>
          <p>Does their campaign content affect their electoral results?</p>
        </section>
        <section class="centered-content">
          <p>As the most symbolic campaign method, the use of slogan attracts public attention and give impression on the candidates that will influence their voting result. </p>
          <p>In this section, we will explore some of the most frequently mentioned slogans from each candidate and analyze their theme, the context in which they ususally appear, and the number of times they appeared in the tweets. </p>
          <p><u><b>Instructions:</b></u> Explore with the chart on the left, pay special notice to the description box on the top right to get hint on ways to continue exploration and possible interpretations. As you explore to the last layer, click on individual bubbles and hover over the slogan bubbles for more detail.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="centered-content">
          <p><b>Are you able to draw any useful information out of the plot? Let's analyze it together now...</b><p>
          <p>Looking at the theme of the slogans, while Clinton's focus on building union with voters explains her advantage in popular vote, Trump advertised way more times of slogans relating to his general campaign, assisting the fame and popularity of his campaign as well. Moreover, Trump's focus on using large quantity of imflammatory ambitious goals through patriotic lens definitely brings him more support, and constitute as part of the reason why Trump's popular vote does not fall behind too much as compared to Clinton's.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="centered-content">
          <p>Different groups cares about different political topics. Hence, which political issue the candidates draw their focus and campaigned on more than others has an impact on whether they will receive more votes from certain groups of people.</p>
          <p>In this section, we will explore and compare Trump's and Clinton's attention to different political topics through analyzing how often they brought up words relating to each category of political issues in their tweets.</p>
          <p><u><b>Instructions:</b></u> Use the plot on the left to explore number of times Trump or Clinton mentioned certain political issues more than the other candidate. Think about the underlying patterns. Hover over each bar to get more detailed counts of each topic.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="centered-content">
          <p><b>Now let's look at some of the patterns together and analyze how they might affect the election result.</b></p>
          <p>Pay attention to Clinton's attention to demographic issues like gender and minorities to win public votes among general publics in liberal states. Also noticing that Clinton has a lot of Spanish tweets and in fact, even opened an account for spanish tweets later, to get votes from Spanish speaking region like California and New Mexico. This might explain her victory in popular vote.</p>
          <p>However, Trump put special focus on serious matters like security issues and highly active with campaign advertisement, those might explain why he got a lot of popular votes too by attracting votes from patriotic groups and conservative states.</p>
          <p>Considering Clinton spent a great deal of focus on Spanish speaking region with high population, which are not swing states and was considerably democratic states already, that might explain why she fall behind in electoral votes in other states.</p>

            <div class="centered-content">
            <p><b>Time to verify your hypothesis and PLAY AROUND!</b></p>
            <p>Now that you have some idea about which topics each candidate spent more focus on. For instance, Clinton takes advantage of her identity and mentioned gender issue with words like "women" three times more than Trump to win supports from general publics with same identity.</p>
            <p>For example, in previous section we see Trump focus on security and international issues more than Clinton, and Clinton focus more on demographic issues. The example words on the left matches with this pattern, and displays closer view on specific words in different topics.</p>

        <p><b>So... What do we learn? Why did Trump won election despite disadvantage in overall popular vote?</b></p>
        <p>While both candidates made efforts to unite voters and establish connections during their campaigns, Trump also emphasized broader political issues such as diplomatic relations and national identity, instead of solely focusing on social issues as Clinton did. This may explain why Trump secured more final electoral votes.</p>
        <p>So in short...</p>
        <p><b>Winning overall popular vote does not guarantee final victory in US election</b></p>
        <p><b>Uniting the voters is as important as advertising visions on serious international and domestic policies for a successful campaign</b></p>
        <p><b>And ... Just like in life, getting control on broader picture prevails over expertise on one specific area is how things go in electoral campaign.</b></p>
